# Anisotropic-Particles
Studying the motion of anisotropic particles in fluids using model discovery.

This repository is part of my ongoing research in the lab of Dr. Michael Schatz at Georgia Tech in the study of solid particle-fluid interactions. Our goal is to discover equations of motion of rigid particles moving through fluids using sparse linear regression (SPIDER, developed by Daniel Gurevich and Matthew Golden). This adresses a real need for computational help in a field rife with paradoxes (Stokes' paradox, D'Alembert's paradox) and mathematical/theoretical difficulties. Computational power has the ability to retain higher order terms that are left out when making linear approximations and discover effects that are theoretically difficult to evaluate such as inertial effects.
